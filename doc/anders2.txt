See the relevant code below; it's called with WriteSubtree(root). It
actually looks very similar to the GNU Go code, except that they have a
special case for the root of each subtree. I suspect your reading code
is the problem rather than the writing code, as your binary tree looks
strange. E.g. 'c' has to be a child node of 'b', not a sibling. But I
may be misinterpreting your tree graphic.

Good luck,

void GameFile::WriteSubtree(Node* pNode)
{
   // Start new sequence on a new line.
   StartNewLine();

   // Opening parenthesis.
   Put('(');
   m_numCharsOnLine++;

   // Write out main sequence first.
   do
   {  Put(';');
      m_numCharsOnLine++;
      WriteNode(pNode);
      pNode = pNode->LeftMostSon();
   } while (pNode && !pNode->HasRightBrother());

   // Now either reached end of branch, or fork in linear sequence.
Write out
   // each subtree recursively.
   while (pNode)
   {  WriteSubtree(pNode);
      pNode = pNode->RightBrother();
   }

   // Closing parenthesis.
   Put(')');
   m_numCharsOnLine++;
} // WriteSubtree
