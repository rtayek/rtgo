Logging.mainLogger.info("restored, root: "+m.root().toString());

sgf is a binary tree (at least my version is).
if the binary tree is a forest then converion to a multiway is problematic.
sgf text -> binary tree -> multiway tree -> model.setRoot()
model.root() -> multiway tree -> binary tree -> sgf text

my RT node is called a sentinal.

new model does not have an RT node.

model.save converts to binary tree and then to sgf.
save will  add a null node before the root if 
if the current root does not have the RT property.
sometimes the binary tree is a forest,
so when save() turns this into sgf format
