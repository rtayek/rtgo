Comment[Recorded by Pierre Glynn using Goscribe 2.0.
Edited by Anton Dovydaitis.
 There are some very strong players who are overshadowed by the top tournament winners. One of them is Ishida Akira who always seems to be rebuffed at the point of major success. However, Ishida Akira has been enjoying good form recently \(his 1976 record was 33 wins to 14 losses\).
 Although he lost the final playoff for entry into the 1977 Meijin League to Cho Chikun after defeating Fujisawa Shuko in the previous round, he has been doing very well in the current Judan title.  He defeated Yamabe 9-dan before losing to Hashimoto Utaro in the winners' section, then in the parallel losers' section he defeated in turn Rin Kaiho, Kudo 9-dan, and then Fujisawa Shuko again.]

;Comment[Black 49 was apparently a slack move, as White cannot do much here in any case. The game now develops into a contest between White's corner profit and Black's influence in the centre and at the top.]

corner. White now had a territorial lead and Black's only hope was to launch a strong attack on the unsettled white group. ]
