Comment[Black one at 'p4' should be the obvious and intuitive play.  This is 
the only reasonable move for Black.]
;
White[oq]
Comment[White is forced to continue with White two at 'p3' or be locked in the 
corner.  White must also consider his stone at 'e4'.]

Comment[The White one space jump at 'n3' is to gain a move and stay on the 
outside.]

Black[qj]
Comment[RIGHT After Black five at 'r10' we can see that Black now has a very large 
potential for a lot of territory.  The sequence Black one through Black five is 
a standard joseki sequence, and this particular joseki is the most efficient 
choice in this position.]

Comment[Black one at 'r9' is too timid.  This move gives White the time he 
needs to develop and strengthen his own position.]

Comment[This exchange illustrates that Black's emphases was not entirely 
intent on developing his potential on the right side of the board as he should 
have been.  ]

Comment[Black one at 'e3' is a very bad play.  Black at this juncture should 
not be too concerned about the weakness for both players at this corner.   This 
move is for later.  This move will also give White the time he needs to destroy 
Black's potential.  ]

Comment[Black one at 'n3' is also a joseki, and it is also a poor choice of 
joseki.]
