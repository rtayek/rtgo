White:  Jiang Zhujiu, Professional 9th Dan

Handicap:  4 stones
Result:  Black resigns]
;Comment[The comments were made by I-Chen Wu.  Jiang Zhujiu's comments 
\(marked "Jiang Zhujiu said"\) are also added.  I still keep my comments
which conflict with his.  The purpose is that you can
find strength difference between pro and amateur comments.  And I would 
like to thank MGT for a lot of help for making the comments.]

;Comment[The move has the following effects: ladders are usually favorite for
white, it is hard for black to build moyo, and black is hard fight when
jumping into the middle area.  I \(black\) started feeling bad from this
move, because I never won a handicap game starting with tengen \(this point\).  Jing Yang, a professinal level player, comments "the move is no big deal and you should think it is far from sides".]

;Black[cq]
;White[bq]
;Comment[This is a bad move, although it does not hurt black too much.  MGT comments that the correct move is B2. If white tries to get the corner,
C7 is a severe move against white.]

;Comment[A good point to intrude my moyo.]
White[lq]
;Black[nq]
;White[lo]
;Comment[If black ignores does not play this move, white can intrude black's
territory at this point.  K6 is another choice.  But, this move is recommended when playing with a stronger player.

Jiang Zhujiu commented that this was not a good move for black to make at this time.   He thought black should play at P6, separating the two white groups instead, and gain access to the center.]
Black[jq]
;Comment[This covering is not firm.]
White[on]
;Comment[So, Black tolerates now
and seeks some opportunity.  This
move also gets the corner and
will be able to connect R8.]
Black[qp]
;Comment[Now, white has to
attack R8 to get some money
back.]
White[qi]
;Comment[Jiang Zhujiu said this was a good move.  He thought black would next 
play at S6 instead, which he does not consider a good move for black.]
Black[ol]
;White[nm]
;Comment[This move is a typical phenomenon of tengen-phobia. :-\)  Obviously, black should play at O8 or P11. Black should think that the group can go home at any time he wants.
The ideal sequence should be
B:O8, W:N8, and B:P11.

Jiang Zhujiu thought black should play at P11 instead.]
Black[rn]
;White[qf]
;Comment[Again, although this is not a big mistake, black should play R15 and then O16 instead. This is another tengen-phobic move.  \(Try to settle as soon as possible.\)]
Black[nc]
;Comment[This is the key point
for both sides' moyo.]
White[em]

;Black[cc]

;Comment[C15 can also be at B18,
but then C12 could be attacked.]
Black[ce]
;White[bd]
;Comment[Black should play the following sequence: B:B15, W:D15, B:B14, W:D17, B:E16, W:C18, B:E14. Then black can get excellent thickness.

Yes, Jiang Zhujiu said black at B15 is the correct play.]

;Comment[Jiang Zhujiu said black should play at D18.]
Black[cb]

;Comment[This is a strange move.
E17 is good enough.]
Black[eb]
;White[bb]
;Black[ec]
;White[ca]

;Comment[This point is big.
But, there is a weakness at
D13.  Black should play at D13
or cut at B14.  E12 looks
interesting, but F15 is still a
little annoying to black.]
Black[jd]
;White[dg]
;Black[cg]
;White[bf]
;Comment[This is one of the black's worst moves.  Black should play F15 to remove its weakness first.  \(It can also make the territory of upper
side larger. \) Then, if white plays at E13, black can play C8 and then C10.  Although, black groups are separate, it still looks not as bad.  Since these moves, black has had less chance to win.  :-\)

Yes, Jiang Zhujiu said this is not a good move.  Black should play at E13 to build a powerful moyo.  \(I-Chen: Well, this is another result of 
tengen-phobia.  I do not think about it even when commenting.\)]

black's groups, although the
territory will become smaller.
Black should make its left
